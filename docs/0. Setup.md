# Setup {#setup-guide}

### 1. Requirements:

* iOS simulator 11.0 and xcode 9.0 and above.
* Android 6.0 and above, supporting both device and simulator. For real device testing please install null-keyboard

### 2. Setup & Run:

##### **Step 1.** Setup Macaca - NoSmoke dependends on the following macaca components:

```
npm i macaca-android -g
npm i macaca-ios -g
npm i macaca-cli -g
npm i macaca-electron -g
```

##### 

##### **Step 2.** Setup NoSmoke - You can choose several ways to run it :\]

**Method 1:** install the nosmoke command line from npmjs

```
npm i nosmoke -g
```

Open the terminal and initialize macaca server `macaca server --verbose`

then in your workspace directory, execute the following command

```
nosmoke -h path-of-your-hook.js -c path-of-your-config.yml
```

For full set of command please check:

```
nosmoke --help

  Usage: nosmoke [options]

  Options:

    -p, --port <d>    port to use (5678 default)
    -u, --udid <s>    udid of device
    -h, --hooks <s>   location of the hook.js file
    -c, --config <s>  location of the configuration file
    -s, --silent      start without opening browser
    --verbose         show more debugging information
    -v, --versions    output version infomation
    -h, --help        output usage information
```

**Method 2**: install via clone from git

```
git clone git@github.com:macacajs/NoSmoke.git
```

Open the terminal and initialize macaca server `macaca server --verbose`

then run the following under the nosmoke root dir:

```
node bin/nosmoke -h path-of-your-hook.js -c path-of-your-config.yml
```

**Note:**  -h is optional and -c \(the path of the configuration file is a must\) in order to run the crawler

**Method 3**: Supporting Docker as well:

```
docker run  --privileged -v  nosmoke-reporter:/root/reports --name nosmoke-1 -p 5037:5037 -it zhaoysamuel/nosmoke-android:1.0.0
```

Note: for docker mode, you need to connect your device and grant the adb access writes to the docker env, otherwise the following error will occur:

```
Error: Command failed: /opt/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools/adb -s 4fea3345 forward tcp:9001 tcp:9001
  error: device unauthorized.
  This adb server's $ADB_VENDOR_KEYS is not set
  Try 'adb kill-server' if that seems wrong.
  Otherwise check for a confirmation dialog on your device.
```

### 3. What you will see

When the npm program starts to execute and browser will automatically open the reporter-monitor, it may take several seconds for the program to start simulator. Once the testing target app installed, the crawler program will start execution and reporter's content will be updated.
